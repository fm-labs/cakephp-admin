/**
 * This JS file is intended to be shared across all backend layouts
 * and can be used to extend/override backend's built-in javascript in your app.
 *
 * # Usage:
 *
 * Create {ROOT}/webroot/backend/js/shared.js and define your scripts.
 *
 * # Note:
 *
 * The script file is inserted into the layout at the bottom of the HTML page (= NOT in the <head> part!!).
 * If jQuery is enabled in the layout, the jQuery object SHOULD be available at this point.
